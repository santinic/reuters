You need an HTTP server to run it, because it uses partial views that cannot be loaded otherwise. 
You can use any simple HTTP server for this purpose. e.g.:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    
then open http://localhost:8000

I would have written tests, but there was no time in "2 hours" for it.
